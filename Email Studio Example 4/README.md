#Simple Tag System

## How it works:
it's a custom tag system for Bewitched Gaming Tournaments. Transmitter Script is showing tournament with tags. After clicking tag link, user will be redirected to a page that shows tournaments with that tag. While on page, user can freerly loop through tags. (AMPScript)

***Remember to place working URLs (for example for your landing page <Marketing Cloud Web Pages)!***
